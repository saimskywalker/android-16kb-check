# android-16kb-check

Your Play Console upload was rejected for 16 KB page alignment, or you want to
find out before you upload. This is a shell script that answers that question
against the actual `.apk` or `.aab` file, on your machine, in a few seconds.

```
$ android-16kb-check app-release.aab
==> artifact : app-release.aab
==> objdump  : /Users/you/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/28.2.13676358/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/llvm-objdump
==> archive  : bundletool (bundletool)

==> Archive alignment
    [ok]   bundle config declares PAGE_ALIGNMENT_16K

==> ELF LOAD segment alignment (must be >= 2**14)
    arm64-v8a      libapp.so                              [ok]   min align 2**16
    arm64-v8a      libflutter.so                          [ok]   min align 2**14
    arm64-v8a      libsomevendor.so                       [FAIL] min align 2**12
    armeabi-v7a    [SKIP] 32-bit, exempt (3 libs)

FAIL — at least one 64-bit library is not 16 KB aligned.
  Play will reject this upload.
```

## The requirement

Since **2025-11-01** Google Play requires 16 KB memory page support for apps
that target API 35 or higher and run on 64-bit devices. It is checked when the
artifact is uploaded, before review, so a failure rejects the build rather than
delaying it.

Two independent things have to hold, and both are checked here:

1. **Archive alignment.** Native libraries have to be stored uncompressed and
   16 KB-aligned inside the zip. The Android Gradle Plugin does this from
   8.5.1 onward. In an AAB it appears as `PAGE_ALIGNMENT_16K` in the bundle
   config; in an APK it is what `zipalign -c -P 16 4` verifies.

2. **ELF alignment.** Every `LOAD` segment of every 64-bit `.so` must be
   aligned to at least `2**14`. NDK r28 and newer link this way by default.

These fail independently. A perfectly linked library stored compressed still
breaks on device, and a badly linked library stored with flawless zip alignment
breaks too. Checking one is not checking the other.

32-bit `armeabi-v7a` is exempt — 16 KB pages are a 64-bit feature — and is
reported as `SKIP` rather than passed over silently.

## Exit codes

| exit | meaning | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Aligned. Archive alignment is correct and every 64-bit library has all LOAD segments at `2**14` or better. | Upload. |
| `1` | Not aligned. Play would reject this upload. | Fix it — see below. |
| `2` | **Could not verify.** A required tool or the artifact is missing, or the artifact has nothing to check. | Install the missing tool and run again. |

**Exit code 2 is not a pass.** This matters more than it looks. A checker that
cannot find its toolchain has learned nothing about the artifact, and the
common failure mode in scripts like this one is to report success anyway —
which turns a build gate into a decoration. Here, every path that could not
look ends in `2`, distinct from both the pass and the fail, and says so in
plain words on stderr.

The practical consequence: if you wire this into a build script, treat `1` as
fatal and `2` as a loud warning that the gate is **unproven**. Never fold `2`
into `0`.

```bash
android-16kb-check "$AAB" || case $? in
  1) echo "unaligned — refusing to release"; exit 1 ;;
  2) echo "WARNING: 16 KB alignment is UNVERIFIED on this machine" ;;
esac
```

Cases that deliberately return `2` rather than `0`:

- No `llvm-objdump`, no `bundletool`, or no `zipalign`.
- An artifact containing no native libraries at all — there was nothing to
  measure.
- An artifact containing only 32-bit ABIs. That proves nothing about the
  64-bit build users will install.
- An artifact whose 64-bit ABI directory holds no `.so` at all — `lib/<abi>/`
  can legitimately contain other files, such as `wrap.sh`. The directory is
  reported as `[none]`, because an ABI that appears nowhere in the report
  reads exactly like one that passed.
- `objdump` present but unable to read a library. That is a tool that could
  not look, not a library that failed; a failure to measure never becomes a
  measured failure.
- `zipalign` present but unable to run the check. Build-tools older than 35
  has no `-P` flag, so its zipalign exits on a usage error rather than
  reporting an alignment; that is not an answer about the archive.
- An archive `unzip` could only partly extract. Whatever came out is a subset
  of the artifact, and a verdict on a subset is not a verdict on the upload.

## Install

It is one file with no dependencies beyond the Android toolchain it calls.

```bash
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/local/bin/android-16kb-check \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saimskywalker/android-16kb-check/main/android-16kb-check
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/android-16kb-check
```

`/usr/local/bin` is root-owned on macOS and on a stock Ubuntu, so without
`sudo` curl exits `56` having written nothing. To install without root, put it
somewhere you own and make sure that directory is on `PATH`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -fsSLo ~/.local/bin/android-16kb-check \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saimskywalker/android-16kb-check/main/android-16kb-check
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/android-16kb-check
```

Or clone the repository and run `./android-16kb-check` in place.

## Usage

```bash
# An app bundle (what you upload to Play)
android-16kb-check build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

# An APK
android-16kb-check build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Point at a specific NDK rather than letting it auto-detect
android-16kb-check --ndk "$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/28.2.13676358" app-release.aab

# bundletool as a downloaded jar instead of a PATH executable
android-16kb-check --bundletool ~/tools/bundletool-all.jar app-release.aab
```

| option | effect |
|---|---|
| `--ndk <dir>` | Take `llvm-objdump` from this NDK. Overrides auto-detection; if the directory has no `llvm-objdump` the run fails rather than falling back to some other one. An empty value is an error, not "no `--ndk` given" — `--ndk "$UNSET_VAR"` must not silently become auto-detection. |
| `--bundletool <cmd>` | Executable, or a path ending in `.jar` which is run as `java -jar`. AAB only. An empty value is an error, as for `--ndk`. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Usage, then exit 0. |
| `-V`, `--version` | Version, then exit 0. |

Environment variables: `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` (or `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT`) is equivalent
to `--ndk`; `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) is used to find the highest
installed `ndk/<version>` and the newest `build-tools/<version>/zipalign`;
`BUNDLETOOL` is equivalent to `--bundletool`.

## Prerequisites

| tool | needed for | install |
|---|---|---|
| `llvm-objdump` | the ELF check, always | ships in the NDK: `sdkmanager 'ndk;28.2.13676358'`. GNU `objdump` on PATH also works — it prints the same `align 2**N` form. |
| `bundletool` | AAB input | `brew install bundletool`, or download `bundletool-all.jar` from [the releases page](https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases) and pass `--bundletool` |
| `zipalign` | APK input | ships in the SDK: `sdkmanager 'build-tools;35.0.0'` |
| `unzip` | reading libraries out of the archive | preinstalled on macOS; `apt-get install unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu |

If the NDK lives somewhere non-standard, set `ANDROID_HOME` or pass `--ndk`.
Auto-detection looks at `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/*` (highest version wins), then
`~/Library/Android/sdk` and `~/Android/Sdk`, then PATH.

## Reading a failure

A `[FAIL]` line names the ABI and the library. That name is the whole answer,
because the fix depends on who built the file.

**Libraries you compile yourself** are aligned by NDK r28 or newer. If one of
yours fails, raise the NDK version your build uses and rebuild.

**Libraries that arrive prebuilt inside a dependency** — an AAR, a Flutter
plugin, a Maven artifact — were built with whatever NDK their author used, and
your own NDK version has no effect on them whatsoever. This is the common case,
and it is the one this tool exists for: your NDK pin tells you nothing about
these files, so they have to be measured on the artifact.

**This tool cannot fix a prebuilt `.so`.** Relinking someone else's binary is
not something a checker can do. The remedy is to find the dependency that ships
the named library and upgrade it to a release built with a 16 KB-capable NDK,
or drop the dependency. If neither is possible, the upstream project needs a
bug report; there is no local workaround.

A failure on the archive half instead — `PAGE_ALIGNMENT_16K` missing, or
`zipalign` reporting bad entries — is a build configuration problem, not a
dependency problem. Upgrade the Android Gradle Plugin to 8.5.1 or newer.

## What this does and does not prove

It proves what a static read of the artifact can prove: how the libraries are
stored in the zip, and what alignment each 64-bit ELF declares for its LOAD
segments. That is exactly the pair of properties Play checks at upload, which
is why passing here and passing there tend to agree.

It does not run the app. A library can be aligned and still crash on a 16 KB
device for unrelated reasons — a hardcoded `PAGE_SIZE` constant, an assumption
about `mmap` granularity, a bundled runtime that pages things in itself. Static
alignment is a necessary condition, not a sufficient one. Testing on a 16 KB
page-size emulator image remains worthwhile.

It also says nothing about libraries loaded at runtime rather than shipped in
the archive.

## Running the tests

```bash
test/run.sh                # everything
test/run.sh toolchain      # a substring filter on test names
```

The suite needs no Android SDK and no real APK. External tools are replaced by
stubs in `test/stubs`, and the artifacts by small archives in `test/fixtures`
that have the right internal layout and nothing else. `shellcheck` runs over
the script, the harness and the stubs in CI.
