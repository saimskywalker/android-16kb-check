# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Because the exit codes are the interface, a change to what any of `0`, `1` or
`2` means is a breaking change and takes a major version, even if the script
looks barely different.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- An artifact whose 64-bit ABI directory contains no `.so` no longer reports
  `PASS` and exits `0`. `lib/<abi>/` can hold files that are not libraries —
  `wrap.sh`, for one — and such a run measured nothing at all while printing
  a green result. It exits `2`, and the ABI directory is now reported as
  `[none]` instead of being omitted.
- `objdump` exiting non-zero is now `2` rather than `1`. A library the tool
  could not read was being reported as `[FAIL] no LOAD segments readable`
  under "Play will reject this upload", which claims a measurement that never
  happened. A library where objdump *succeeds* and prints no readable LOAD
  segments is still `[FAIL]`.
- `--ndk ""` and `--bundletool ""` are rejected instead of being treated as if
  the flag were absent. `--ndk "$UNSET_VAR"` used to fall through to
  auto-detection, which is the silent fallback `--ndk` exists to prevent. The
  `--ndk=` form already errored; the two forms now agree.
- Auto-detection picks the highest installed NDK again. Versions were sorted as
  whole paths on `.`, which put the directory prefix in field 1 where a numeric
  compare reads it as `0`, so the major version was never compared: with
  26.3.x, 27.0.x and 28.2.x installed it chose **26.3.x**.
- CI is green on `ubuntu-latest` again. `test/run.sh` disabled only `SC2329`
  for its indirectly-invoked test bodies; the shellcheck 0.9 that Ubuntu ships
  reports the same finding as `SC2317`, so the lint step failed there while
  being clean on a current local shellcheck.
- The documented install command works as written. It wrote to root-owned
  `/usr/local/bin` without `sudo`, so it failed with `curl: (56)`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-27

First release.

### Added

- `android-16kb-check <path.apk|path.aab>` — checks archive alignment and the
  ELF LOAD alignment of every 64-bit `.so` against Google Play's 16 KB page
  requirement.
- Three-way exit code: `0` aligned, `1` unaligned, `2` could not verify.
  `2` is deliberately distinct from `0`; a machine without the toolchain
  reports an unproven gate rather than a pass.
- `--ndk` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` / `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT` for naming the NDK that
  supplies `llvm-objdump`. An explicitly named NDK is authoritative: if it has
  no `llvm-objdump`, the run fails instead of falling back to another one.
- Auto-detection of the highest `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/<version>`, the newest
  `$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/<version>/zipalign`, and `~/Library/Android/sdk`
  or `~/Android/Sdk` when no SDK root is set.
- `--bundletool` and `BUNDLETOOL` for AAB input, accepting either an
  executable or a `.jar` path run through `java -jar`.
- 32-bit ABIs reported as `SKIP` rather than omitted, so an exempt ABI cannot
  be mistaken for one that passed.
- `--help` and `--version`.
